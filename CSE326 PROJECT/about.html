	<h1><span id="s1">“Retro Foods had its humble beginnings.</span><span id="s2"> Just me, a
		<br>smoker, and an age-Young challenge—cooking
		<br>brisket."</span></h1>
		<br>
		<p id="p1">John Rivers never set out to create the most successful BBQ chain in Florida. He’s <br>
			not a classically trained chef or graduate of culinary school. It was in Texas that he <br>
			found the two loves of his life: his wife and the delicate art of brisket. And it’s been <br>
			 those very two godsends that inspired Retro as we know it.</p>

		<p id="p2">John spent 20 years in the healthcare industry before retiring as president of a <br>
			billion-dollar company. During that time, he had the opportunity to travel the <br>
			country, honing his taste and talent for brisket perfection. As he soaked up the <br>
			flavors and practices of ‘cue fare countrywide, John’s dream of de-regionalizing <br>
			BBQ was born.</p>

	<h2><span id="s3"> "This was never supposed to be a restaurant. </span><br> <span id="s4">
		 My definition of helping meant doing what felt <br>
		  most natural when comfort was in order—feed <br>
			those in need."</span></h2>
	<p id="p2">		Retro Smokehouse began with the launch of the “Barbecue <br>
	Ministry” in 2004, when John hosted a cookout fundraiser to support a local family <br>whose young daughter was battling cancer. This one event resulted in a passion <br>for supporting local schools, churches, and charitable organizations, and a few <br>years later, smoking thousands of pounds of meat out of a garage just wouldn’t cut <br>it anymore.</p>

	<p id="p2">After trials, tribulations, and a whole lot of burnt ends, we finally flipped that “Hot <br> Brisket Now” sign on in October of 2009. Within the first hour, a line had formed <br>out the door…and then around the corner.</p>

	<p id="p2">Today, we have several locations across the state of Florida, with plans for<br> continued expansion and more than 1,000 amazing folks on our 4 Rivers team.<br> Most importantly, the Barbecue Ministry remains our foundation and<br> focus, and will until the cows come home.</p>
